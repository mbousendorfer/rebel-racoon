"""Static dev server for the prototype — `python3 -m http.server`, made to survive the app.

The app is ~230 ES modules and ~50 stylesheets, and every `npm run bump` changes all
their URLs at once, so a reload asks for all of them in parallel. The stock server
listens with a backlog of 5 and speaks HTTP/1.0 (one connection per file): past the
fifth pending connection the kernel resets the rest, and the browser drops whatever
was in them — a stylesheet here, a module there. The page then renders with random
pieces missing (the grey fills of the right panel went first, 2026-09-30) and nothing
in the code is wrong.

Two changes fix it: a 256-deep backlog, and HTTP/1.1 keep-alive so the browser
reuses a handful of connections instead of opening one per file.

Usage: python3 scripts/dev-server.py [port]   (default 8000)
