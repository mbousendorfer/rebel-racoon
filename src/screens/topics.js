// /topics — the Topic Feed: a queue you triage, with the article beside it.
//
// ── Scope ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// One Playbook at a time, carried in `?pb=`. NOT a global active-Playbook: the
// version this was ported from had a module that owned the app's scope, persisted
// it, and was written to by a select sitting in this page's filter bar — so a
// control that promised a page filter silently re-scoped the sidebar, the next
// new chat and the composer's picker. `?pb=` says the same thing, survives a
// link, and stops at this screen. The settings page reads the same param, so the
// scope survives the round trip in both directions.
//
// ── The layout ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Master–detail, and the split is measured with a @container query on the row
// itself rather than a media query: the sidebar collapses and the right panel
// overlays, so viewport width never tells you content width.
//
// The list SHRINKS when the article opens. That is the fix for the port's worst
// bug: with the list pinned at a fixed 666px the article had nowhere to go under
// ~1180px of content width, so at 1440px of viewport — a 14" laptop — clicking a
// card rendered the article 1900px below the fold and nothing appeared to happen.
//
// ── Paging ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Ten at a time, and the last page's sentinel loads the next when it scrolls into
// view. There is an explicit Load more too, and both do exactly the same thing —
// an infinite list with no button is unusable by keyboard.
