// Topics — the section page for the dossiers Agorapulse listening produced,
// route /topics.
//
// One stream across every Playbook, newest first, each card carrying the Playbook
// it came from. Not a right-panel mode: the panel is session-bound by the shell
// rules, and a topic belongs to a Playbook and arrives on a cadence long before
// any chat exists to hold it.
//
// Laid out like a paper — a lead story, then sections — because a run of equal
// cards has no answer to "what should I read first?" and that is the whole job
// here. The layout itself lives in topics-feed.js, shared with the front page at
// `/` (flag `frontPage`): this route is EVERYTHING, filtered and archived; the
// front page is a short curated selection of the fresh. Two surfaces, one engine,
// no duplicate.
//
// The config (Topics settings) is NOT here. It lived as a tab on this page and that
// gave it equal billing with the feed, which is wrong for something you set once and
// then leave alone for months — it's a settings page now, screens/topics-settings.js.
// It isn't on /playbook/:id either: a Playbook is a fact sheet, and which feeds are
// live is operational, not declarative.
//
// Cadence is copy, never a timer — a weekly tick would never fire inside a demo
// session. The recurring feel comes from "Refresh now": a scanning state, then a
// batch of unseen dossiers on top. See topics-store.refreshTopics.
//
// Modelled on screens/connectors.js — flag guard, teardown/paint/bind, delegated
// listeners, store subscriptions, and teardown returned to the router.

// — always-visible toggles over a small flat set → filter-chip list. This facet
// used to be a select alongside the Playbook one, and it was correct for a page
// that was a filtered list; it's wrong for a page that's a publication.

// Playbook is exactly the trap the config page escaped: it cannot survive twenty.
// A select can, and it shows its selection without being opened — which a trigger
// reading "Filters (2)" cannot.
//
// (The DS's Filters dropdown — V2 Molecules, a 420px checkbox panel with Clear /
// Apply — remains right when the user composes a multi-value set and applies it in
