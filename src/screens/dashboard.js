//   1. First-time onboarding — isNewUser() with no Playbook yet → /welcome-alt.
//   2. Returning user — most recent session, or /session/new if none.

// `/` renders nothing of its own, deliberately. This is a tool you come to with
// a task already in mind, so the landing page is the chat you were last in.
//
// It DID render something once: behind the `frontPage` flag, `/` became a
// magazine front page filled by the listening feature — a lead story, a grid of
// six, section chips. That went out with the Topics magazine it was built on
// (see the Topic Feed § in CLAUDE.md). If a front page comes back, it comes back
// on top of the Topic Feed's own data, not as a second reader of a second store.
