// ---- Insights — the read stack the mob_ lectures share -------------------------
//
// Both `mob_` readings (Index / Side) render THE SAME objective fiche; what
// differs is how they arrange its blocks — Index stacks them behind a crumb,
// Side deports three of them into a right-hand column. So the blocks live here,
// one function each, and the hosts compose them. (Band was the third host until
// it was deleted on 2026-09-11.) Same idea as `pieces.js`, one rung up: pieces owns the
// vocabulary (a verdict is a DS status pill, everywhere), this owns the SECTIONS
// that vocabulary is assembled into.
//
// ⚠️ Cockpit is deliberately NOT re-pointed at this module. It is the reference
// the mob_ lectures are being compared against,
// and rewriting them would invalidate the comparison — so their own copies of
// this stack stay exactly as they are. The duplication is the price of an
// intact baseline, and it ends the day one reading wins: the losers and this
// module are deleted together.
//
// THE FICHE IS A PAGE HEADER OVER ONE REPORT CARD PER MEASURE. That is prod's
// own arrangement: in Reports a page is a HEADER naming its subject and then a
// stack of `Card / Report card (to detach)` (Figma `Analytics - Shared
// components`, node 1070:7477), ONE PER METRIC — each with its own grey band
// (name · description · a white synthesis box of that metric's figures) over
// its own white body (that metric's chart).
//
// So `Brand awareness` is the page's title, and `Reach` and `Brand mentions`
// are two self-contained blocks under it. What that deletes, and it is the
// point: the five-column measures table, its counter, and the SELECTOR — with
// every measure charted in its own card there is nothing left to switch. Three
// rounds of design went into where that selector should sit (a DS tab strip
// over the chart, then rows above it, then rows below it, rejected); the answer
// turned out to be that a page with two measures doesn't need one.
//
// Pure render helpers — strings in, strings out, no listeners. Every action is
// a `data-ins-*` hook the shell dispatches (shell.js § Actions).

// H1 rung, the action held at the far right where prod keeps `Download chart`.
//
// It carries the OBJECTIVE's own facts and no measure's: the provenance, the

// the measure count is legitimate again now that no `Measures N` counter exists
// twelve pixels below it.
//
// There is no big numeral here either. `74%` is `Reach`'s progress, not the
// objective's: it now lives in Reach's own card, where the number and the curve
// that produced it are the same block. What answers "how is this objective
// doing" at the page level is the verdict pill, which is a word.

 * repeated four times nothing on the page is emphasised, which is what made
 * this page read as flat.
 *
 * It comes back for the states that have no figure to show — a collecting
 * objective, or one with no measure yet — where a sentence is all there is.
 * When it does, it lands in the report card's DESCRIPTION slot, under the
 * title — prod's own two-line paragraph in grey-80 (`Card / Title+synthesis`).
 *
 * The proxy note rides with it, unconditionally: it is the only thing on the
 * page that says WHY a number is standing in for another, and no figure carries
 * that. Both belong to the OBJECTIVE, not to a measure, so they sit in the page
 * header — which is also the one white surface on the page, and an
 * `.ap-infobox` on a tint reads as muddy.

// ── One measure, one report card ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The block, transcribed from Figma `Analytics - Shared components` →
// `Card / Report card (to detach)` (1070:7477) and its head
// `Card / Title+synthesis` (1069:7931), with the geometry read off the file
// rather than guessed: band padding 24, the white synthesis box inset in it at
// padding 16, its cells separated by a 1px × 40 rule with 24 either side.
//
// The card is ONE measure:
//   • band — the metric's name at the h3 rung (the objective owns h1, one rung
//     up, in the page header), its scope in prod's description slot, its state
//     pill where prod holds `Download chart`;
//   • the synthesis box — `Progress` as the 38px numeral (the platform's
//     `.main-data`, borrowed from `Card / Key metrics` 432:6310, whose `Value`
//     is a big figure), then `Current`, `Target` and `Variation`, one fact per
//     cell, prod's label-over-value. The four labels read as a row because the
//     cells are top-aligned, and they are all NOUNS — `Progress`, not "of
//     target", which only reads right AFTER its figure, not above it;
//   • body — that measure's curve, full width, and nothing else.
//
// ⚠️ No sub-title over the chart. Prod has one (`Engagement overview` under
// `Engagement`), which is prod naming the same metric twice; the card's band
// already says `Reach` forty pixels above the plot.
//
// ⚠️ The lead cell falls back to the CURRENT VALUE when a measure has no
// progress to show — `progressPct` is null for the lower-is-better metrics — and
// the `Current` cell then drops, because a big `—` over a number that is right
// there is a hole where the answer should be.
//
// `specs` is the map the host hands to `mountCharts` after the innerHTML lands;
// the chart nodes are placeholders until then, which is what keeps these
// functions free of DOM.
