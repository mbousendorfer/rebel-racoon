// ---- Insights · Mob · Index — the index, then the fiche ------------------------
//
// TWO LEVELS, no selector at all: a full-width index of every objective, and the
// one you click read at the page's full width behind a crumb. It is the shape
// every analytics product with goals in it ships — Asana, Monarch, Customer.io,
// Deel, HubSpot, Charma, TheyDo — and the only one of the six lectures here that
// still works at ten objectives with history behind them.
//
// WHY it exists: Cockpit spends a 340px column of full viewport height on a list
// of two or three, next to the app's own rail. This one asks whether the
// selector has to be on screen AT ALL while you read. Nothing else on the page competes with the objective once it
// is open, and the index gets the whole width to be a table instead of a gutter.
//
// ⚠️ FOURTH SHAPE for this index. Each one lost for a reason that is written
// down — read the list before drawing a fifth:
//   1. a TABLE of eight 14px columns. It hierarchised nothing: the objective's
//      name weighed exactly what the six figures beside it weighed. Cut twice,
//      the second time flatly — "le tableau n'est définitivement pas la bonne
//      représentation".
//   2. a 2×2 GRID of cards carrying figures only. Too close to Bento, the tile
//      board cut before it: "a number without its curve" (shell.js).
//   3. one FULL-WIDTH ROW per objective, all rows on one internal grid so the
//      percentages aligned down the page. Comparison worked; the row didn't —
//      across 1200px its six zones read as loosely related cells, and the user
//      preferred the row's own FOLDED state to its resting one.
//   4. this — that folded state promoted to the resting shape, two per line,
//      with the curve inside the card under the figures.
//
// So the card IS the fold: name, verdict and the way in on one line; the
// percentage and the measure it is OF under them; the trajectory beneath both.
// Nothing was invented for it — the zones and their classes are the row's own,
// which is why the fold's `@container` block was deleted rather than reworked.
//
// WHAT KEEPS IT OUT OF BENTO: **every card carries its CURVE** — `trendSpec`
// with `compact`, which keeps the dashed target line and the post markers and
// drops only the axis labels. That was the whole indictment of the tile board,
// and shape 2 above is the one that failed on it. The percentage is not
// doubled either: no ring, and no bar since the curve took the card — one
// numeral for how far along, one curve for versus what.
//
// No KPI strip above the grid, Deel-style: `tierCounts` in the head already
// says On track / At risk / Off track, and a band restating those three numbers
// is exactly the fault that got Report's ring row cut. The head carries WEIGHT
// instead (brand + counts on one line, the shared "N posts drafted" sentence)
// and not one new figure.
//
// No outer card around the grid either — a card inside a card is nested
// elevation, and the section title does that job for free.
//
// The two states key off `?objective=` — which `shell.js` hands over as
// `selectedKey`, already nullable. So "nothing selected" is a state this layout
// gets for free, and a link still lands straight on a fiche.
//
// The brand switcher lives on the INDEX only, deliberately. `playbookTitle` is
// the app's only door to the scope outside workspace mode (pieces.js), and the
// fiche is one permanently visible crumb away from it — the same escape Asana
// and Monarch give their goal pages. A second switcher on the fiche would be two
// controls that can disagree, which is the failure that note warns about.
