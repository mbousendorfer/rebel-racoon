// ---- Insights · Mob · Side — full width, the facts on the right ----------------
//
// One page, no left rail. The objective's NAME is the selector, and the narrow
// column moves to the right where it carries FACTS instead of navigation — which
// is what Monarch, Plane and Adaline do with theirs. The curve gets the wide
// side, which is the half Cockpit was starving: a 7-column table and a 300px
// chart were living in the smaller of two columns while a list of three rows
// held the bigger one.
//
// So the trade this lecture tests: a right column is affordable because it holds
// things you GLANCE at (the window, the provenance, how many measures, what is
// missing) and it can stick to the top of the scroll. A left column holding
// navigation is not, because navigation for three items is a dropdown.
//
// The head is two lines, Monarch's own: the brand above, the objective below.
// The Playbook's name is not decoration there — outside workspace mode
// `playbookTitle` is the ONLY door to the scope in the whole app (pieces.js), so
// a lecture that dropped it would make its brand unchangeable.
//
// The verbs stay in the head, never in the column: a 300px column grows
// full-width buttons, and a button is never full-width here.
