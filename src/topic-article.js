// The Topic article — ONE renderer, three hosts.
//
// The feed shows it beside the list, the picker shows it inside its own dialog,
// and the in-chat list opens it in that same dialog. All three call the functions
// here, so there is exactly one article and no way for two of them to drift
// apart. Same shape as playbook-view.js and connectors-view.js: pure render
// helpers, no store reads beyond the title resolver, no DOM, no listeners.

//   renderTopicHeader(topic, { source, menuOpen, titleFirst, withMenu })  the identity
//   renderTopicArticle(topic, { source, withHeader, actions, withPosts, headerOpts })
//   renderTopicPosts(topic, { collapsible })            the evidence (inline or a panel)
//   renderTopicActions(topic, { close })                the two verbs

//   renderTopicTrail(topic) / trailLength(topic)        the trail, for its hosts
//   renderTopicStates(topic)                            the state chips, for the card too
//
// ── The identity is ONE ORDER, and the ARTICLE follows the CARD ───────────
// Provenance, then the claim, then the verbs: the card has always led with its
// meta run — badge, source, age, state chips — and the article header now leads
// with the same one. A card and the thing it opens must not present one object two
// ways round, and the card is the shape a reader meets first and meets twelve
// times, so it is the article that moves.
//
// It is the editorial kicker: the small line that says WHERE you are before the
// headline says WHAT it is. Which also puts the source and the age at the top of
// the pane rather than tucked under a 24px title, and a reader triaging a
// listening queue is asking "who, and how recently" as much as "what".
//
// ⚠️ The other direction was built first — claim on top in both — on the argument
// that the claim is the identity and the caption line is identical on every card
// while `competitor-posts` is the only live source. Turned down for the CARD and
// the feed PANE: their order is provenance-then-claim, and it stays.
//
// The wider article DIALOG is the ONE exception, on purpose: it passes `titleFirst`
// so the claim is the hero and the "Competitors · age · status" run sits under it —
// a two-column reading surface has room to lead with the title, where the card and
// the one-column pane do not. Same renderer, the order is a host option.
//
// The chips are exported for the same reason the order is shared: they were
// declared in the card and nowhere else, so opening a Trending Topic dropped the
// word "Trending" — the card and the article disagreed about what the Topic IS.
// One renderer, both hosts.
//
// ── Why the identity is its own renderer ───────────────────────────────────
// The feed's pane keeps its header OUTSIDE the scroller, so the title stays put
// while the analysis scrolls. The kebab rides in its top-right corner; the two
// verbs are NOT up here — they sit at the FOOT of the read, on a sticky bar the
// article renders between the analysis and the evidence, so the reader decides
// having just finished the thing they are deciding on. That bar floats at the
// pane's bottom edge while a long analysis scrolls and settles above Contributing
// posts at the end (see renderTopicArticle's `actions` slot and the CSS on
// `.topic-article__actionbar`).
//
// The dialog composes the same pieces differently: two columns — the identity and
// the analysis on the left (title-first), the contributing posts EXPANDED in a grey
// panel on the right (renderTopicPosts, collapsible false) — with the verbs in a
// footer and Topic history a button beside them (no header kebab). That is the
// host's business. What may NOT differ is what the identity and the verbs SAY,
// which is why both are rendered from here and nowhere else.
//
// ── What the article is ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The two triage facts, the analysis in its two authored sections, and the posts
// the analysis was written from. Nothing else — and in particular no version
// history: an updated Topic reads as its current version, because a reader
// deciding what to post does not need the draft that preceded it.
//
// The TRAIL is no longer part of it. It sat last, in a collapsed accordion, and
// spent the reading surface's one framed box on something that is meta rather
// than argument — see the note above renderTopicTrail.
//
// ── Why the two facts are in the ARTICLE and not in the header ────────────
// They were in the header for one commit, on the argument that triage criteria
// belong with the identity and the verbs that act on it. The measurement killed
// it: the fixed header went from 125px to 291px — 32% of the pane — and, worse,
// its height then varied with whichever fields a Topic happened to carry, so the
// scrollport resized every time the reader opened the next Topic.
//
// They are the article's FIRST band instead, so nothing about the reading order
// or the visual layout changes: facts, then the analysis, then the evidence, then
// the trail. What it buys is a header of one fixed height, and parity between the
// two hosts — in the dialog the facts already scrolled, because the dialog renders
// the header inline. One placement, one behaviour.
//
// It carries no "Why now" block of its own beyond those rows. The card used to
// repeat the reason a Topic was flagged while the mark above already said THAT it
// was flagged, and it could only ever show two clamped lines of an explanation
// whose whole value is the detail.

// prose, then the apparatus stated in one line, then the evidence on demand. Same
// judgement that moved the trail behind the kebab, one step short of it: the trail
// is meta, this is the argument's own footing, so it stays in the article.
//
// ⚠️ THIS REPLACED A CAP, and deliberately: the section used to show the first two
// posts and put the rest behind a second "N more posts" link. A collapsible
// section plus that link is TWO nested disclosures for one list, and the reader
// has to operate both to see six posts. So `POST_CAP`, `__more` and
// `__posts-rest` are gone — open the section and every post is there.
//
// ── ALWAYS closed, whatever the kind ─────────────────────────────────────
// ⚠️ `later` Topics opened expanded for one commit, on the argument that they
// have no draftable angle so the posts ARE the material. It was the wrong trade:
// a resting state that changes with a field the reader cannot see is a rule they
// have to discover, and the panel it was protecting is not actually empty — a
// `later` Topic still shows its title, its facts and its full analysis (136 words
// on average) above this line. `8d8d0b4b` was about REPLACING prose with a false
// placeholder, which is a different thing from folding supporting evidence behind
// a labelled, counted disclosure. One resting state, no exception.
//

//   • this renderer is PURE and has three hosts, none of which has anywhere to
//     keep an open flag — the same reason the trail used one;
//   • `.ap-accordion` would put a FRAMED BOX around blocks that already wear a
//     fill. The article has exactly one framed species (the two facts) and one

// ── The state chips: ONE species, five tones, TWO hosts ───────────────────
// Every state a Topic carries renders as a DS Tag — `.ap-tag <tone>` + glyph +
// word, from the tone and icon topics-catalog declares per state.
//
// This lives HERE, beside the header it belongs to, and `topic-card.js` imports
// it: the chips are part of a Topic's identity, and the identity has exactly one
// declaration in this feature. It was private to the card, which is why the
// article header carried no signal at all — a reader who clicked a card marked
// Trending landed on a page that never mentioned it.
//
// ⚠️ This replaced TWO renderers that put one vocabulary at two levels: the two
// signals were already DS pills, while Already used and Ignored were bare neutral
// icons with a `title`, and For later was not on the card at all — it was a whole
// tab. A pill, an icon and a tab for what a reader thinks of as one list.
//
// ⚠️ IT WAS `.ap-status`, and that was the wrong sibling. Status has no icon slot,
// so the glyph had to be smuggled into the dot's place with `no-dot` — a modifier
// whose whole job is to REMOVE the dot, used to repurpose it. Tag styles `> i` and
// `> span` as real slots (12px glyph, 180px truncating label), carries a border as
// well as a fill so a chip has an edge, and ships the five tones this vocabulary
// needs. Height, radius, padding and type all resolve from --comp-tag-*, so this
// still costs no CSS of its own.
//
// One consequence, and it is a fix: Tag has no plain-`orange` modifier. Trending
// wore `orange` — the AI / spotlight ACTION colour the header's Use-in-chat primary
// owns — on a static chip. It takes `tagOrange` now, and Updated moves to
// `menthol`, cool against Trending's warm so the two signals differ rather than
// reading as two shades of one thing.
//
// `new` renders nothing, and that is the design: it is the absence of an answer,
// the most common value in any feed, and a glyph meaning "nothing has happened
// yet" is the one thing a glyph cannot say. It keeps its filter row.
//
// A Topic can wear more than one — Already used AND Trending is a real state, and
// showing both is the point. They sit in one group at the end of the meta run so
// the run wraps as a unit instead of one chip at a time.
//

 * The footer's verbs.

 * `close` omits it, for a host that already renders one (the pane puts it in the
 * header, opposite the title).
 *
 * Use in chat is the PRIMARY and it is ORANGE: it hands the Topic to Archie, and
 * orange is the AI / spotlight action everywhere else in this app. Ignore is a
 * stroked grey secondary, not a red one — ignoring hides a Topic that ticking
 * Ignored brings straight back, so nothing is destroyed and red would be flagging
 * a danger that is not there.
 *
 * An ignored Topic swaps Ignore for Un-ignore: one slot, two directions, never
 * both, because they are one decision read from opposite ends.
