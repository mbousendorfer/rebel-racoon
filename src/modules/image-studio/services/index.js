// Image Generator — the service registry. The ONE place implementations are
// chosen: swap a mock for a real client here and nothing else changes.
//
//   imageGenerationService  brief + brand + style + product + format + text mode → variations
//   copyService             hooks, CTAs, captions, hashtags
//   editService             edit an image in plain words
//   productService          a product page URL → name, description, image
//   storageService          CRUD of the module's own entities + blobs
//
// Brand analysis (URL or files → brand DNA) is no longer the module's: the brand
// is the Playbook, and analysing a site or files is how a Playbook is CREATED —
// src/context-mock-analysis.js (analyzeWebsite / analyzeBrandFiles).
