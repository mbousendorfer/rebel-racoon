// surface reads from.
//
// CONFIG, not content: it ships with the app and must exist in `new-alt` mode
// too — a brand-new user still sees all eight source cards on the settings page.
// The Topics those sources produce are content and live in mocks.js, empty for a
// new user. Same split as ff-catalog.js (config) vs mocks.js (data).
//
// `accent` is a SEMANTIC KEY, never a hex — the view maps it to
// `.topic-badge--<accent>`, which resolves DS colour tokens.
//
// `live` — false means the source is not built yet. Toggling it opens the
// feedback modal and leaves the switch alone, rather than pretending it works.
// Only competitor-posts is live, and that is load-bearing: the feed's default
// source filter is derived from LIVE_SOURCE_IDS, so a Topic seeded on a
// non-live source would be filtered out of its own feed on first paint.
//
// `playbookAnchor` — never an id — says which Playbook section a source reads,
// so a card can offer "Review the Playbook's competitors" without hardcoding a
// source id. null = Agorapulse listening feeds it directly and the Playbook has
// nothing to do with it.
//
// `howItWorks` is plain informative prose. It began life as a greyed-out
// read-only textarea on the fork; that read as a broken input, so it is text. Do
// not reintroduce a disabled input here.

// read as promises made in conversation ("I only raise a theme once ten people
// have voiced it"), which is the wrong register for a switch you set once and
// leave running for months. So: "every post is read", not "I read every post".

// reads one lane at a time.
//
// ⚠️ HISTORY, so this is not re-litigated. This axis was a tab row (`AC-SEG`),
// then withdrawn into a flat six-state filter where `later` was one row you
// unticked. That flat filter is now gone too: the panel is three grouped
// controls (Topics · Marked as · Sources), and `kind` is the radio again —
// reinstated deliberately, with the docs (`AC-SEG`, `AC-FILT`) rewritten to
// match. `git log -S renderStateSelect` has the flat-filter version.
//
// The fork carried a `researchType` of `ready-to-post` / `content-strategy`
// mapped onto `ready` / `later` at render time, and its predicate also read a
// CONTENT PILLAR (a pillar-linked `content-strategy` Topic counted as ready).

// ── ONE vocabulary of CHIPS ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Six states, one level, as the marks a Topic wears. This replaces three
// separate declarations — REVIEW_STATUSES, ATTENTION_SIGNALS and two kind labels
// — which is what put the things a reader thinks of as one row of chips at three
// levels of prominence: a DS pill for the signals, a bare icon for the triage
// states, a whole tab for the kind. One pill species now.
//
// ⚠️ TOPIC_STATES drives the CHIPS (card + article header), the state deriver
// (`topicStates`) and the trail labels — NOT the Filters panel. The panel keys
// off `kind` (the Topics radio), the answered statuses (Marked as) and the
// source, so a state and its filter can never be the same control. `defaultOn`
// below is a chip-rest hint, no longer a filter default; the filter's default
// lives in topics-store's `defaultFilters`.
//
// ⚠️ THE DATA MODEL DID NOT FLATTEN, and must not. `status` lives in the triage
// Map (the reader owns it), `isTrending` / `isUpdated` live on the Topic and are
// purged outside 7 days (the scan owns them), `kind` lives on the Topic. FOUR
// fields, still separate — which is exactly what lets a Topic be Already used
// AND Trending and show both. Collapsing them into one field would let a re-scan
// overwrite the reader's answer, which is the whole reason the triage Map exists,
// and would break the wire contract (AC-TRK-6) that reports the three
// independently. `facet` below is how each row knows which field to read.
//
//   facet: "status"  → compared against the triage status
//   facet: "kind"    → compared against kindOf(topic)
//   facet: "signal"  → an independent boolean on the Topic
//
// `tone` is the DS `.ap-status` variant, `icon` its glyph. Every state carries
// BOTH a word and a glyph, so colour is never the only signal (AC-X-4).
//
// `chip: false` on `new` is the one asymmetry, and it is deliberate: it is the
// ABSENCE of an answer, the most common value in any feed, and a glyph meaning
// "nothing has happened yet" is the one thing a glyph cannot say. It would have
// spent a mark on nearly every row to convey nothing. `new` is also the panel's
// baseline — every lane shows its To-review Topics without a control, and the
// "Marked as" group only adds the answered ones on top — so it needs no filter
// row either.
//
// `hint` is a sentence, never a restatement of the label: a tooltip reading
// "Used" over a chip labelled Used has told you nothing.
//
// ── The three tones that changed, and why ─────────────────────────────────
// `ignored` was `red`. The feature's own closed arbitration says the opposite —
// "Ignore is stroked grey and NOT red: ignoring hides a Topic that ticking
// Ignored brings straight back, so nothing is destroyed and red would flag a
// danger that is not there." The contradiction survived because nothing read the
// field; the card drew a bare neutral icon instead. Reading it makes it visible,
// so it gets fixed.
//
// `used` was `blue`, justified by a green "Ready-to-draft tag" whose fill would
// have collided. ⚠️ That tag does not exist — the only `.ap-tag` on any Topic
// surface is the grey "Coming soon" in the filter panel. The reason was stale, so
// green is free, and blue was the wrong colour anyway: blue is the colour of the
// INTERACTIVE in this app (card hover border, links), and a blue pill on a
// clickable card reads as a control. Green is validated / done, which is what
// Already used means.
//
// `later` takes the blue `used` vacated — info / neutral. Parked, not judged.
