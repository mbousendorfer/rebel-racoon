// Scripted assistant threads, per session.
// Seed data only — no network, no persistence, no randomness.
// Re-exported by ../mocks.js, which stays the single import path.

// ---- Assistant thread seeds (per-session conversation history) -----------
//
// Each demo session gets a scripted thread so opening one looks like a
// real, mid-flight conversation instead of an empty hero. Turns mirror
// the live assistant.js shape exactly — assistant.js's seedThread()
// clones each turn, assigns a fresh id + createdAt, and drops them into
// the per-session thread map. Brand-new sessions (id === "new" or
// runtime-created) keep the default greeting → empty hero path.
//
// Ids on draft/extraction sub-items reference the actual ids in
// postsBySession / ideasBySession so the cards link back to the real
// content on click.
