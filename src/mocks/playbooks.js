// reversed one from the footer, the square icon, the favicon. Shared between the

// both, the way it would if both had been scraped from the same site.
//
// The reversed lockup carries its own dark plate INSIDE the SVG. That's how a
// brand kit presents it, and it's also the only way it survives being shown on a
// white thumbnail tile — a white-on-transparent mark would render as an empty box.
