// The Topic Feed: one listening feed per Playbook, and the Topics themselves.
// Seed data only — no network, no persistence, no randomness.
// Re-exported by ../mocks.js, which stays the single import path.

// ---- Topic feeds + Topics (the listening feature) -------------------------
//
// A FEED is one Playbook's standing query: which sources it watches, how often,
// and which sites the Brand-website source reads. Two are seeded; every other
// Playbook gets one provisioned on first read (topic-feeds-store), so nobody
// ever meets a screen asking them to set listening up before anything happens.
//
// A TOPIC is what a scan assembled: a headline, an article in two sections, and
// the posts the article was written from. `kind` is the segment it lands in and
// comes from the scan alone — "ready" is draftable now, "later" is a theme worth
// keeping. `isTrending` / `isUpdated` are the two attention signals, and they are
// independent of `seedStatus`: a Topic can be Used and trending at once. Signals
// only apply inside the first age group, and topics-store enforces that on read
// rather than trusting what is written here.
//
// `ageLabel` is a relative phrase, not a date — a prototype has no clock worth
// trusting, and authored dates rot as the file ages. It is the ONLY age input:
// the card's "2d ago" and the group it sits under both derive from it, so the two
// cannot disagree. topics-store.ageMinutes is the seam to replace with real
// timestamps.
//
// `seedStatus` gives the landing feed a real triage spread rather than twenty-one
// identical To-review rows, and `seedReason` carries the sentence a reader typed
// when they ignored one — the Ignored state is meaningless without it.
//
// `posts[].author.accent` is a semantic avatar tint resolved in
// social-post-card.css — never a hex. Zero engagement counts are OMITTED rather
// than written as 0: the card prints labelled figures, and "0 reposts" is worse
// than nothing.

      "Gracie Barra and Six Blades are both pushing youth programs on character building — 'raise boys who are kind, confident, and capable' — and taking students as young as four. The claim is everywhere; the mechanism behind it is explained nowhere.",
    relevance:
      "This is the claim that decides whether a Carlsbad parent books a trial, and they are being asked to take it on faith. Explaining the mechanism is the whole opening.",

      paragraphs: [
        "Across the tracked Carlsbad academies, youth programs are being sold on character: kind, confident, capable children, sometimes from age four. The shift is a good one, and it is now the category default rather than a differentiator. What none of the posts do is answer the hesitation that actually stops a parent signing up — whether martial arts will teach their child to settle conflict with their fists.",
        "That question has a real answer, and it is structural rather than cultural. Most martial arts are striking arts: they train a child to meet conflict with immediate outward aggression. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is grappling — leverage, technique and control. A child is taught to neutralise a threat, control a situation and escape safely, which is a fundamentally different instinct to rehearse. Every movement is cause and effect, so the training rewards keeping a cool head and thinking, not swinging.",
        "The mat culture is the other half of it. A child who does not feel safe cannot build resilience — an environment that is chaotic or overly competitive puts them in survival mode, and character development stops there. The clearest expression of the opposite is the tap: when a partner taps, everything stops, immediately and without exception. That single rule teaches respect for someone else's boundaries and that it is safe to admit you are caught. Strength is for protecting and controlling, never for intimidating.",
        "This is also why capable children fight least. Bullying runs on insecurity in both directions — the aggressor proving dominance, the target projecting fear. A child who knows with certainty that they could control a confrontation, and do it without hurting anyone, has nothing left to prove. That is the angle the local conversation has left open: not that character development matters, but how it is actually produced.",

      paragraphs: [
        "In a category full of participation trophies, the youth belt system is unusually honest — and unusually badly explained. Children move white, grey, yellow, orange, green, earning up to four stripes inside each rank. Those stripes are the mechanism worth talking to parents about: for a young child a year is an eternity, and stripes break an intimidating goal into phases small enough to feel. Each one is a signal that daily effort is compounding.",
        "The reason it works is that the recognition is earned rather than given. A promotion arrives after a child has worked through frustration, refined something they were bad at, and shown up disciplined when they were tired. That teaches the thing empty praise cannot: that their success sits entirely inside their own control. Confidence built that way does not break when life produces a setback.",
        "The mats behave like a laboratory for that. A student chasing a stripe will hit plateaus — a position they cannot escape, a newer partner who suddenly gives them trouble — and with decent coaching they learn to read those as information rather than failure. The question shifts to 'what do I do differently next time?'. Children who discover that consistency produces progression on the mats start applying it to schoolwork without being told to.",
        "There is a practical parent angle here too, and it is a corrective. The instinct is to compare — why did another child get a stripe first? The more useful move is to ask what they improved today rather than what they received, to normalise plateaus rather than apologise for them, and to model showing up on the days motivation is low. That is the piece the promotion posts never carry.",

The local signal is that plenty of people in North County are having that thought — former white belts who trained for a few months three years ago, coloured belts who took a multi-year break for work or family.",
        "The obstacle is almost never conditioning. It is that your brain remembers techniques your body cannot yet execute, so timing and spatial awareness lag behind knowledge. Force the gap closed with raw athletic effort and the injury rate climbs. The useful reframe is to stop trying to win rounds and start collecting data: accept that you will be slower and more easily fatigued, and treat that as a temporary state rather than a new baseline.",
        "Physically it wants a ramp, because grappling loads the neck, shoulders, lower back and knees, and a desk-bound body needs to re-adapt to that. Three things do most of the work: a real warm-up that mobilises hips and shoulders, controlled intensity — you are allowed to decline a roll or ask to keep the pace down — and positional sparring from closed guard or side control instead of open scrambles, which is where injuries happen.",
        "Which makes the choice of academy the actual decision. A room that treats every round like a championship final is a poor bet for someone returning, or for anyone who has to be functional at work tomorrow. A structured adult curriculum rebuilds fundamentals in a cooperative setting before adding resistance, and coaches who watch mat dynamics will pair a returning student with partners who are safe rather than eager.",

In fashion stores and across social media, heavy autumn collections and winter coats are already being pushed everywhere. Yet it is far too early to permanently banish your favorite summer items to the attic.",
        "The secret to effortless style during this transitional period lies not in hastily purchasing a complete autumn wardrobe, but in masterfully combining light layers. As a Belgian multi-brand expert, we at Noba Fashion know how quickly our climate can shift. With a few cleverly chosen basic pieces from our wide brand selection, you can transform your summer outfits into autumn-proof combinations in no time.",
        "A successful transitional look relies on garments that adapt easily to temperature fluctuations. Lightweight knitwear is the ultimate in-between piece: a finely knit cardigan or a thin cotton sweater goes over a summer dress or top in the morning, and around your shoulders as soon as the sun breaks through. Timeless denim and light trousers form the foundation — enough protection against a cool breeze, and they pair effortlessly with both sunny tops and autumn blazers. And a versatile mid-season jacket, whether a classic trench coat, a denim jacket or a refined overshirt, instantly elevates any look while staying practical for life on the go.",
        "Fashion is about smart combinations, not monthly overhauls. An airy summer dress gains an instant autumnal feel layered under a tailored blazer, with open sandals swapped for closed-toe shoes or ankle boots. A sleeveless summer top carries over just as easily under a fluid button-down shirt worn open as a light jacket. Combining different brands within a single outfit gives you the freedom to refine your personal style — functional for the morning rush, elegant for work, comfortable for the weekend.",

By resisting the urge to jump straight into heavy winter wear and focusing instead on thoughtful transitional layers, you get the absolute most out of your closet.

        "A successful sale purchase meets three simple criteria: the fit is perfect, the quality is exceptional, and the item fits seamlessly into your daily lifestyle. Ask yourself with every item whether you would consider buying it at full price — if the answer is yes, you have found a genuine gem. During the final markdowns that points at three categories: a timeless, well-cut blazer in a neutral shade such as navy, sand or black; high-quality jeans or trousers from a top brand with a great fit; and classic knitwear and blouses — crisp white shirts, finely knit wool or cotton sweaters, neatly finished tops.",

A capsule wardrobe is ideally around ten well-coordinated garments you can mix and match effortlessly.

Instead of getting lost in overcrowded racks filled with fleeting trends, a thoughtful shopping visit helps you build a reliable wardrobe you can count on.

        "As summer days shorten, the fashion world's color palette transforms. This season sees a clear shift toward deep, warm tones that exude luxury and calm. The absolute showstopper of this autumn is plum — a refined, deep brownish-pink shade — accompanied by warm earth tones like rust brown, chocolate and soft terracotta.",
        "While these rich colors look stunning on mannequins, many women wonder how to translate this trend into their own daily wardrobes. Nobody wants to purchase a head-to-toe outfit that feels dated after a single season. At Noba Fashion, we show you how to introduce these trend colors subtly and stylishly.",
        "Plum serves as the perfect bridge between classic and modern: it has the warmth of brown and the softness of pink, which makes it a surprisingly accessible color for virtually every skin tone. Wear it as a stylish accent — a plum handbag, belt or scarf against grey trousers and a white blouse — or as a statement top, a fluid blouse or knit sweater with your trusted blue jeans, which gives an everyday look extra character without feeling over-the-top. For those who want to make a statement, tone-on-tone with soft pink or warm brown is softer than black-and-white and remarkably elegant.",
        "Alongside plum, rich earth tones form the foundation for a harmonious autumn look, and the key to wearing them lies in playing with textures. A warm brown suede skirt paired with a smooth cotton top, or a rust-colored cardigan layered over a denim shirt, creates engaging visual dynamics that a single flat color cannot. The benefit of a wide multi-brand selection is that different shades of brown and plum from various brands sit side by side in one place, so you find the exact nuance that makes your complexion glow.",
        "Fashion should remain fun and, above all, fit who you are. You don't need to reinvent your entire style to follow the latest trends: adding just one or two key pieces in plum or a warm earth tone gives your familiar outfits a fresh, contemporary appeal. With the right balance between striking trend colors and timeless basics, you can step out the door this autumn feeling confident and stylish.",

The vocabulary is shared too — orchestration layers, intelligence units, autonomous teammates.",

One approach reorganises a legacy suite into purpose-built component apps — publishing, care, listening, advocacy — governed by a central agent, and keeps protocol bridges open so listening data flows into whatever AI tool the rest of the company already uses. The other positions its product as a standalone conversational command surface wired directly into its own tools; a third framing presents the software as one link inside a practitioner's stack rather than the platform itself.",
        "Underneath the two shapes is one number worth repeating: a provider's own research claims most senior marketing leaders already run AI tools that have no access to live social data. Both architectures are answers to that, and they ask opposite things of you — bring your own AI and let the data reach it, or bring your work to the vendor's chat.",
