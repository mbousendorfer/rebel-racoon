// Topics — what Archie found in a feed, plus what the reader did with it.
//
// GLOBAL and feed-keyed, like topic-feeds-store: a Topic arrives on a cadence
// and belongs to a feed, not to a chat.
//
// ── The one invariant this store exists to protect ─────────────────────────
// `status`, `isTrending`, `isUpdated` and `kind` are SEPARATE FIELDS and must stay
// that way. No signal is a fourth status; both are independent booleans. A Topic
// can be Already used AND trending, or Ignored AND updated, or several at once.
// No code path may write a signal into `status`, and nothing a reader does may
// write `kind`.
//
// ⚠️ The six STATES a reader sees are one flat vocabulary (topics-catalog's
// TOPIC_STATES) derived from those four fields by `topicStates()`. That is a
// presentation layer, not a merge: flattening the fields themselves would let a
// re-scan overwrite the reader's own answer — the exact thing the separate triage
// Map exists to prevent — and would break the wire contract that reports status,
// trending and updated independently (AC-TRK-6). One vocabulary, four fields.
//
// The consequences the views depend on:
//   • In the FEED, a signal never puts a Topic on screen on its own. Trending and
//     Updated are card CHIPS, not filter rows: a Topic shows because of its lane
//     (kind) and its answered-status, and a signal only decorates it. So a
//     trending Topic that has been ignored stays hidden until the reader ticks
//     Ignored — a signal cannot make the filter lie because the filter never
//     reads it. See matchesFilters.
//   • An IGNORED Topic is never surfaced by a signal, anywhere. Ignore means
//     ignore: ticking Ignored in "Marked as" is the only way to see one. The
//     opposite rule — "a spike is never hidden by triage" — was tried and
//     dropped: it made Ignore a suggestion rather than an answer, and the one
//     thing a reader wants from "not this one" is that it stays gone.
//
// Triage lives in its OWN map rather than being written onto the Topic: a Topic
// is what the scan returned (server-owned), a triage row is what this user did
// with it (user-owned). Keeping them apart means a re-scan can replace Topics
// without clobbering triage.
//
// Public API:
//   getTopicsForFeed(feedId, filters?) → Topic[]  (newest first, filtered)
//   groupTopicsByAge(topics)           → [{group, topics}] in AGE_GROUPS order
//   countToReview(feedId)              → number   (the sidebar's unread mark)
//   countFresh(feedId)                 → number   (the in-chat list's M)
//   getFreshTopics(feedId)             → Topic[]  (the in-chat list, capped)
//   getTopicById(id)                   → Topic | null
//   topicTitle(topic)                  → string
//   topicStates(topic)                 → string[]  (the six-state vocabulary)
//   countAll(feedId)                   → number   (the list header's total)
//   defaultFilters() / narrowedGroupCount(filters)
//   getStatus(id) / getIgnoreReason(id)
