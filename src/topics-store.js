// Topics store — the dossiers Agorapulse listening produced, account-wide.
//
// GLOBAL, like connectors-store, not per-session: a topic belongs to a Playbook
// and arrives on a cadence, long before any chat exists to hold it. The /topics
// feed spans every Playbook (each card carries a Playbook chip), and the sidebar
// counter deliberately sums the whole account — the notification is account
// level even though the config that produced it is per Playbook.
//
// Public API:
//   getTopics()          → Topic[]   (visible = not dismissed, newest first)
//   getTopicById(id)     → Topic | null
//   getUnseenCount()     → number    (drives the sidebar nav counter)
//   markSeen(id)         mutates + notifies
//   dismissTopic(id)     mutates + notifies  — hidden, not deleted
//   restoreTopic(id)     mutates + notifies  — the dismissal toast's Undo
//   refreshTopics()      → Topic[]   (the mock scan; drains the seeded pool)
//   subscribe(fn)        → unsubscribe
//
// A topic shape (see mocks.topics):
//   { id, contextId, sourceId,
//     headline,       — the claim, used as the card title and the dialog title
//     analysisTitle,  — the heading over the written analysis
//     summary,        — one clamped paragraph on the card
//     analysis: [ … ],— the prose paragraphs
//     posts: [ … ],   — the source posts behind it (renderSocialPostCard)
//     ageDays, unseen, dismissed }
//
// `ageDays` — not a real timestamp — is the single source of truth for age: the
// feed groups on it AND every "3 days ago" label is derived from it via
// topicWhen(). A prototype has no clock worth trusting, and mock dates that drift
// as the file ages read worse than a stable "3 days ago".
