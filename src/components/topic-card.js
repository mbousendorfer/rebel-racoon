//   renderTopicCard(topic, { variant: "widget" })  the SAME body with no button in
//                                                  it, for a row of the in-chat
//                                                  picker widget (below)
//   renderTopicsWidget({ topics, … })              the composer's "Pick from the
//                                                  Topic Feed" turn: radio cards
//
// The widget variant is not a fourth look — it is the feed/picker body, part for
// part, minus the <button>. It exists because that body has to sit inside a
// radio <label> (the DS `.ap-radio-card`), and interactive content cannot nest
// in a label any more than a button can in a button — see the note at the end
// of this header. Everything inside the body was already a <span> for exactly
// that reason, so the widget costs one wrapper and nothing else.
//
// There WAS a third shape — renderTopicRow, a full-width row for the new chat's
// hero. Six of them stacked ran ~500px tall and pushed the workflow starters off
// the fold, and a row cannot carry an action without becoming a card anyway. The
// hero now renders the picker's card in a grid, so a Topic looks the same
// wherever it is read, and the shape count went down rather than up.
//
// The feed and the picker emit the SAME CARD, part for part — same frame, badge,
// age, status glyph, signals, headline, summary. A reader who has just been
// reading the feed must not be handed a different-looking object when they open
// the picker. The only difference is that the feed's card can be the one
// currently OPEN beside the list and the picker's cannot: one click there chooses
// the Topic, so nothing stays selected long enough to need marking.
//
// The feed variant was called `row` for one commit, when the list really was a
// continuous surface ruled by hairlines instead of a column of cards. That went
// too far — a wall of cards comes from the gaps and the weight, not from the
// cards having edges — and it left the screen as one 1440px slab belonging to no
// other surface in this app.
//
// The card also carries the reader's own progress: an untriaged Topic is set in
// the headline's full weight and a triaged one drops back a step. That is the
// unread/read idiom every mail client uses, and it is the other half of why the
// `new` status renders no glyph — the card's weight already says it.
//
// ── The order is the CARD's order, and the ARTICLE follows it ─────────────
// The meta run, then the claim, then the summary — and the article header renders
// the meta run, then the claim, then its verbs. One object, one reading order,
// whether you are looking at the door or standing in the room.
//
// ⚠️ The two disagreed until now: the card opened with "Competitors · 2h ago" and
// the article opened with the headline, so a reader crossing from one to the other
// met the same Topic laid out two ways. The CARD is the shape that wins — it is
// the one a reader meets first and meets twelve times over, and its meta run is
// the editorial kicker: the small line saying where you are before the headline
// says what it is. The article moved.
//
// ⚠️ It was built the other way round first — claim on top in both, `6777c2ad` —
// on the argument that the claim is the identity and that the kicker is identical
// on every card while `competitor-posts` is the only live source. Turned down.
// Don't re-propose it.
//
// The kebab keeps the top-right corner, on the meta run's line, and the RUN pays
// for its clearance rather than the whole body: the headline and the summary get
// the full measure, which is what they lost to a gutter reserved for a control
// they never sat beside.
//
// ── The card is a reading surface, not a control panel ─────────────────────
// The body is ONE BUTTON covering the whole text area, and it opens the article.
// The verbs live in the article's own footer, where the reader has just finished
// reading the thing they are deciding on — the earlier shape asked them to decide
// from two clamped lines of summary. The kebab is the shortcut for the reader who
// does not want to open the full read.
//
// The kebab is a SIBLING of the body button, never inside it: a button inside a
// button is invalid HTML and the browser resolves the nesting unpredictably.
// Everything inside the body is a <span> for the same reason — a button may only
// contain phrasing content, so no h3 and no p in there.
