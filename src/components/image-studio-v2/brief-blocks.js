// Image Studio — the brief, read and edited as BLOCKS. One renderer, two hosts.
//
// `derivePrompt` stores the brief as one prose string of "Label: value" lines. The
// structure is therefore already in the text; this module just stops hiding it —
// the label recedes to a caption and the value carries the weight, so a block reads
// as an answer under a question rather than as a form field.
//
// Its host is setup-stage.js's Advanced pane. It stays a module of its own because a
// block is a SUBJECT with its own rules — how it is parsed out of the prose, that
// typing in one is the takeover, how an edit writes back to its own line — and the
// stage is the layout that hosts it. Placement there, meaning here.
//
// Every block is a field, ALWAYS — there is no read-only mode and no "edit it
// yourself" link to press first. Typing in one IS the takeover
// (image-studio.js#commitBriefLine), which is what stops the next option change from
// overwriting it.

// real value and a brief line describing it. One field, the real one, and the prompt
// line follows from it.
//
// It leads, and leads bigger: those words are the only part of the brief that ends up
// literally visible in the artwork, so they outrank a description of them.
