// Image Studio — the References section of the settings panel.
//
// ONE section, one reference image. Brand kit used to be a separate row above
// this one, and that was a distinction without a difference: both hold images the
// generator should look like. Where an image CAME from is a label on the tile, not
// a reason for a second section — split across two, you had to check two places
// to answer one question ("what is this going to look like?").
//
// State model: `playbookRefs` and `uploadedRefs` are two POOLS, `selectedRefId`
// is the choice, and `referenceImages` stays a derived array of 0 or 1 — because
// the prompt, the generation seed and the Style-preset lock all read "the
// references in play" without caring how many. `MAX_REFS` bounds the upload pool,
// not a multi-selection.
//
// Note on class names: the `isv2-sheet-*` classes below were written for the
// flyout sheets these panel sections replaced. They dress the panel now. See
// settings-view.js for the full note.
