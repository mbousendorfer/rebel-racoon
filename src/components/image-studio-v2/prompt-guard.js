// Image Studio — protecting a hand-edited brief from the options that rewrite it.
//
// An option doesn't nudge a line of the brief, it re-derives the whole thing. That's
// fine while the brief is Archie's — it's his to rewrite — but once the user has
// typed in a block, the same click silently throws their words away. So a brief that
// has been taken over makes the options ask first.
//
// Two surfaces, one subject:
//   promptGuardDialog(st)    the confirmation, when a change is parked
//   offerUndoIfNeeded(st)    the toast that puts a replaced brief back
//
// ── Why this dialog is not confirm-modal.js ─────────────────────────────────
// `confirm-modal` registers with modal-coordinator, and `requestOpen` closes the
// active overlay before opening — which here is the studio itself. Its close()
// runs `imageStudio.exit(KEY)` and deletes the whole session: variations,
// overlays, every setting. An "are you sure you want to lose your prompt?" that
// loses the entire studio is worse than the problem it's warning about.
//
// So this one renders INSIDE the studio body, from state, on the same one-way
// path as everything else, and never touches the coordinator. The cost is that
// dismissal is ours to wire: events.js takes Escape in capture, before the
// studio's own document-level Escape-to-close sees it.
