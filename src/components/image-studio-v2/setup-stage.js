//
// The options are the form, Generate is its submit, and the brief is the answer to
// "what did you actually send?" rather than the thing you have to fill in first.
// There is no prose prompt field anywhere in the generate flow.
//
// Two earlier arrangements were removed rather than kept behind a flag, and are worth
// naming so they don't come back: a prose brief in a bottom composer with the options
// pinned to the stage's left edge in a 284px rail that ran out of height and clipped
// its own controls (git log -S isv2-panel), and one where the auto-written brief WAS
// the stage with the options as a bar of popover modifiers under it
// (git log -S isv2-bs-mod). Both landed the user on a brief before there was anything
// to brief about.
//
// ── Three decisions worth defending ──────────────────────────────────────────
//
// 1. The pane switch is a CHIP PAIR, not `.ap-tabs`. The modal header already carries
//    an `.ap-tabs` strip (Generate | Edit); a second one 300px away "would read as a
//    competing mode switch beside the real one" — the stated reason the Image / In feed
//    toggle uses `.ap-filter-chip` + `aria-pressed` (stage-view.js#viewToggle). Using
//    the same primitive also makes this strip symmetric with the one facing it in the
//    preview header.
//
// 2. Advanced is DISABLED until an image exists, exactly the way the header disables
//    Edit, with the same sentence. What it holds is the prompt that produced the image
//    on screen; offered before there is one it would be a draft of a brief, which is
//    the surface this variant exists to remove.
//
// 3. The layout NEVER changes — two halves from open to commit (`.isv2-bs`), so
//    switching pane or landing an image reflows nothing. The options half scrolls
//    internally; the preview half does not.
//
// 4. The form has a MEASURE (~520px, left-aligned in its half) rather than filling it. At
//    the half's full width a row put its label at one edge and its value at the other with
//    400px of nothing between them — the pair stopped reading as a pair. A form is one
//    of the few things that should be narrower than the space it has.
//
// 5. The DENSITY is the DS's, not the pinned panel's. These same seven rows run at 36px in
//    a 284px rail, where every pixel counts; in a 520px card that reads as a table. Under
//    `.isv2-opts` a row takes `.ap-list-panel-item`'s geometry (40px, `xxs sm`) and a
//    section body takes `.ap-accordion-content`'s padding and gap — the DS components for
//    "rows inside a bounded card" and "an expanded section". FEATURES §7bis has the table.
//
// The brief's blocks (brief-blocks.js) and the preview column (preview-column.js) stay
// in modules of their own: each is a subject with its own rules — what a brief block IS
// and how it commits, what the preview shows in each of its four states — and this file
// is the LAYOUT that hosts them.

// The seven rows, verbatim from the settings panel — same sections, same state, same
// data-* hooks — each now its OWN card.
//
// This dropped the "What's in the image" / "How it's made" group headings and the two
// bounded group-cards they sat over. FEATURES §7bis argued for those groups (the order
// encodes "ce qui va DANS l'image, puis son traitement", stated rather than implied); the
// user overruled it — the headings read as chrome the options didn't need, and one card
// per option separates them more cleanly than a labelled group of rows did. The order
// still carries the reasoning by sequence, not by a caption. `settingRowEntries` already
// returns them in that order, so the pane is just their cards in a row — the card recipe
// lives in CSS (`.isv2-opts .isv2-acc`).
