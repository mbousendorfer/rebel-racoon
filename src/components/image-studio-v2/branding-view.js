// TWO switches, not one: "Show my logo on the image" and "Use brand colors". The
// logo and the palette are different impositions on an image — plenty of posts
// want the brand's colours without its wordmark in a corner, and a launch visual
// may want the mark on someone else's artwork. One switch for both made the cheap
// half hostage to the expensive one. Both default ON when the Playbook has the
// material; a switch with nothing behind it stays VISIBLE but disabled, with the
// reason underneath — a control that disappears leaves you wondering whether the
// option exists.
//
// No placement setting, just a preview of the mark: it lands bottom-right, full
// stop (BRAND_MARK in image-studio.js). Signing a visual bottom-right is the
// default for the same reason it is on paper, so the only decision left is
// WHETHER the mark appears — which makes "here is the logo I would use" the one
// thing this section owes the user, and seeing it is what catches a wrong or
// stale logo before generating.

// "match" overpromises and says nothing about WHAT gets matched. Naming the three
// things also names the three modes below, which are exactly those axes.
// Both halves of the section, and the one thing the controls can't say: WHERE the
// mark lands. That stopped being choosable, so the tooltip is the only place left
// that states it. Worth carrying on a disabled row too — a Playbook with neither a
// logo nor colours still gets told what the section would have done.
