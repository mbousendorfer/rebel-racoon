// Image Studio — the seven option rows, and the controls inside them.
//
// They are the LEFT HALF of the generate stage (setup-stage.js hosts them, one card
// each). This module owns what a row is and what its body holds; where the rows sit
// is the stage's business. They used to be a 284px inspector pinned to the stage's
// left edge beside a mostly-empty canvas — `git log -S isv2-panel` has it.
//
// Row order is "what goes IN the image" first, then treatment:
//   References · Text in image · Branding   what the image is made of
//   Type · Style · Format · Output          how it gets made
//
// Each row is a DS `.ap-accordion` — THE CLASS, NOT THE BEHAVIOUR. Sections are
// independent: one you opened stays open, and opening a second doesn't shut the
// first. One-at-a-time kept the panel short but meant you could never see two
// settings at once and it closed things behind your back. State lives in
// `collapsedGroups` (a Set of what's SHUT), which leaves `openPopover` meaning
// only what its name says — the Edit-mode flyouts, which are one at a time.
//
// ── A note on class names ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `isv2-sheet-label`, `isv2-sheet-hint`, `isv2-sheet-switch` and
// `-switch-label` were written for the flyout SHEETS these sections replaced.
// They dress the panel now. `isv2-sheet-body` / `-title` still belong to the one
// real sheet left (the Add-image flyout, tools-view.js). The names stayed because
// renaming them means touching two stylesheets and four modules for something no
// user can see — this note is the disclosure instead.
//
// Hierarchy inside a row body is ONE binary: dark = it names the thing below it
// (`.isv2-sheet-label`, `.isv2-sheet-switch-label`), light = it is an aside about
// that thing (`.isv2-sheet-hint`). No second size and no bold — three bold labels
// stacked in a 260px column would shout over the section title.

// One setting = one DS Accordion section, expanding IN PLACE.
//
// This replaced a stack of `.ap-select` triggers that threw flyout sheets over
// the image. Sections are the better tool for three reasons: the options land
// next to the label they belong to instead of across the canvas, nothing has to
// be positioned (no flyout can fall off an edge), and with no sheet needing to
// escape it the panel is finally free to scroll — the `overflow: auto` trap that
// bit this file three times simply stops existing.
//
// `.ap-accordion` brings the frame, the header row, the title, the toggle and
// its 180° rotation on `.collapsed`.
//
// NOT an accordion in behaviour, despite the DS class: a section the user opened
// stays open, and opening a second doesn't shut the first. One-at-a-time kept the
// panel short, but it also meant you could never see two settings at once and
// every section you'd opened shut itself behind your back. State lives in
// `collapsedGroups`, which leaves `openPopover` meaning only what its name says:
// the edit-mode flyouts, which ARE one at a time.
//
// `pinned` opts a row out of that: it is always expanded and never collapses, so
// its header stops being a control — a static row rather than a <button>, with no
// chevron and no toggle hook. Nothing to press means nothing that can mislead, and
// it never enters `collapsedGroups` at all. The value still rides in the header:
// with the body open it is a summary of what's below ("Acme · 3") rather than a
// stand-in for it.

  // it — the value, the chevron — keeps the right edge exactly as before. Without

  // the panel's own scroll box can't clip it, and tabbing to the header shows it,

// dimension from the style":
//
//   Type  = a COMPOSITION schematic. Monochrome, geometry only, DS greys — how is
//           this image laid out? Greyscale on purpose: electric blue is this house's
//           interactive colour, and a blue shape inside an unselected card would read
//           as "selected" against the very marker that means it.
//   Style = a COLOUR swatch. Its palette, gradients, contrast — what does this image
//           look like? This is where the colour lives.
//
// One markup, nine CSS modifiers, zero assets — the `.sub-preview--*` pattern from
// clip-subtitles.js. Chosen over SVG because a card's art scales with the option
// card it sits in: a composition expressed in % is resolution-free, where nine
// fixed-viewBox SVGs would need per-stroke `vector-effect` and would put nine blobs
// of trusted HTML in a JS module. Sizing rules live with the CSS.
