// social-post-card — one published post by SOMEONE ELSE, shown as evidence.
//
// Deliberately NOT top-post-card. That component resolves identity through the
// brand's own connected profiles and frames its numbers as a performance
// decision (the ×-vs-average hero, a Repurpose CTA, a permalink built from your
// own post id) — it assumes the post is yours. A competitor's or a creator's
// post has an author who isn't you, and its engagement is evidence for a claim
// rather than a metric you act on. Hence a separate, quieter card.
//
//   renderSocialPostCard(post, { compact }) → one evidence card
//
// Pure render, no store reads, no interactive children — the whole card is
// inert. Post shape (see mocks.topics):
//   { id, network, publishedOn,
//     author: { name, handle, initials, accent }, text,
//     likes, comments, reposts }
//
// `compact: true` drops the engagement row and clamps the text to two lines —
// for when a single representative post rides inside a chat turn or a card
// footer rather than a reading surface.
//
// The network mark uses the DS `-official` glyphs, which carry the brand's own
// colours baked into the icon (they're SVG data-URI backgrounds, not font
// glyphs), so nothing here has to hardcode a third-party hex.

  // ── The anatomy is the product's own listening card ──────────────────────

  // order: top (avatar · identity · date), content (the text), bottom (engagement).
  //
  // What changed to match it:
  //   • the network mark is a BADGE ON THE AVATAR (`.ap-avatar-network`, a shipped
  //     class this app was not using) instead of an icon floating at the card's top
  //     right. That is where a reader of the real product looks for it, and it
  //     couples the network to the author rather than to the card.
  //   • the identity splits in two: `name · @handle` on one line with the DS's 4px
  //     dot separator, then the date on its own line. It was `@handle` over
  //     "Network · date", which spent the second line on a fact the avatar badge
  //     now carries and hid the full name entirely.
  //   • avatar 40px, not 32 — mini-post's size.
