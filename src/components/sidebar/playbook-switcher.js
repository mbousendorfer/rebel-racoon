// for the list, what a global scope costs, and why there is no "All playbooks"
// row here.
//
// It sits UNDER the wordmark and ABOVE New chat, which is the whole claim of
// the layout: Archie is the product, the brand is the scope, and everything
// below the switcher — New chat, Search, the nav, the chat list — belongs to
// the brand named in it. Same DS `.ap-select` as the composer control it
// replaces, inline label included: a scope that hides is only safe while it is
// legible, and the label is what says WHAT is being switched.
//
// Collapsed rail: the dot alone can't be legible, so the button doesn't try to
// switch — it re-opens the rail, where the name is.
