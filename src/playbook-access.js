// Who may do what to a Playbook.
//
// A Playbook has exactly one owner and one of three scopes (doc §5.3):
//   "personal"     — only its owner sees it
//   "members"      — a FIXED list of colleagues may SEE and USE it
//   "organization" — a DYNAMIC list: everyone in the org, joiners included
//
// Whichever way it reaches you, only the OWNER may edit it.
//
// ⚠️ For two weeks this file said "there is no named sharing" and shipped two
// scopes. The doc has three, in both its versions (§5.1, §5.3, §6.1, lot L2),
// and the arbitration that removed one was never written down anywhere — so the
// doc won. The fixed-vs-dynamic distinction is the part it insists on making
// legible, which is why `members` is a real scope with a list and not an
// "organization" with a count beside it.
//
// ⚠️ The store deliberately keeps returning everything. Filtering inside
// contexts-store would make the degraded-chat banner impossible to write: a chat
// whose Playbook stopped being shared still has to name it ("this chat used
// Nutrix · product launch"), which means reading a Playbook you may no longer
// open. So the store holds the facts and this module holds the rights — every
// surface asks here, and `revokedContextFor()` is the one place allowed to look
// past the gate.
