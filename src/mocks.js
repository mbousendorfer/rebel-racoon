// conversation has no user message yet. Surfaced as the big card grid under
// the composer in the empty-chat hero (renderEmptyHero in screens/session.js).
// Each card maps to a REAL Archie capability and is one of three kinds:
//   • `prompt`     — clicking pre-fills the composer with an editable prompt.
//                    The `{{source}}` / `{{video-source}}` placeholders are
//                    resolved at render time to the first attached (video)
//                    source filename, or the literal "your source" / "your
//                    video" for first-run users.
//   • `action`     — clicking launches a guided flow instead of injecting text.
//                    Handled in session.js's starter click delegation:
//                      - "open-batch"       → Batch Studio source-intake screen
//                      - "open-video-clips" → scripted video intake + clip flow
//   • `comingSoon` — a teaser card rendered non-interactive with a "Coming
//                    soon" badge. No prompt/action fires on click.
//
// `subtitle` + `cta` drive the visible card copy; `prompt` is still carried on
// the element (data-starter-prompt) so prompt-kind cards inject clean text.

//     sort, `ref` for the inline citation snippet shown on each card

// Draft on an idea card, Archie suggests 4 AI-generated angles (title +
