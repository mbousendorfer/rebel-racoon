// Deep links that open an overlay — for a screenshot, or to share one.
//
// The Figma sync workflow captures the app screen by screen, and a modal or
// a right-panel mode has no URL of its own — it lives behind a click. These
// two query params give the capture tool, and anyone sharing a link, a way in:
//
//   ?openModal=<id>                                        [&tab=upload|url|connectors]
//   ?openPanel=drafts|ideas|sources
//
// The modal ids are the keys of OVERLAYS below — that map is also what
// /handoff/overlays.html renders, so the index page and the dispatch cannot
// drift apart. Only overlays that open with NO target are in it: a dialog that
// needs a post, a Topic, a Playbook or a source has nothing to show without one.
//
// Note they are SEARCH params, not hash params — the hash belongs to the
// router (url-state.js), and the capture tool drives both independently.
//
// Kept out of app.js so the entry point stays a route table plus a boot
// sequence: this is tooling, and it is the only reason those overlay modules
// are imported twice in the app's graph.
