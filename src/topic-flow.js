// Launches the in-chat interaction for a topic.
//
// "Start a chat" is the only forward action a topic offers (the other is
// Dismiss). Rather than invent a new downstream surface, it hands the topic to
// the chat as a SOURCE — the same move a repurposed top post makes — so every
// affordance the app already has (Extract ideas, Draft a post, Ask about it, the
// Sources panel) lights up on its own with no new plumbing.
//
// Two halves, because the entry point and the choreography live on opposite
// sides of a navigation:
//   • openTopicInChat(topicId)         — from a topic card or the topic dialog:
//     arm the handoff and navigate to a fresh chat, pre-bound to the topic's
//     Playbook and named after its headline (both via query params, which
//     session.js already reads when minting a `new-*` session).
//   • startTopicChat(sessionId, id)    — consumed at session mount: echo, attach,
//     and open on Archie's read of it.
//
// Version pins MUST match session.js's so the assistant / sources-stream /
// inline-question module instances are shared — each holds per-session state in
// a module-local Map, and a second copy at a different URL would hold its own.
