// Topic → chat. The one forward action a Topic has, from the four surfaces that
// offer it: the feed card's menu, the article beside the feed, the in-chat fresh
// list, and the composer's Add menu.
//
// It hands the Topic to a chat as a SOURCE. Rather than invent a downstream
// surface, it reuses the one the app already has — so Extract ideas, Draft a
// post, Ask about it and the Sources panel all light up with no new plumbing and
// no special case anywhere.
//
// THREE surfaces hand it to a NEW chat, across a navigation; the composer hands
// it to the chat the reader is ALREADY in, inline:
//
//   useTopicInChat(topicId)             feed card / feed article / hero card:
//                                       mark it Used, then navigate to a fresh
//                                       chat bound to the Topic's Playbook
//   attachTopicToChat(sessionId, id)    consumed at session mount (the handoff)
//                                       AND by the inline picker's confirm:
//                                       attach as a ready source
//   startTopicPickerInline(sid, sess)   the composer's "Pick from the Topic Feed":
//                                       one Archie line + an in-thread widget
//                                       of the feed's draft-ready Topics, the
//                                       same shape as "Top performing posts"
//
// ── Why the composer stays in the chat ─────────────────────────────────────
// The composer's Add menu is where a reader pulls things INTO the chat they are
// writing in — a PDF, a URL, their top posts. Every neighbour in that menu acts
// in place; a Topic that opened a second chat was the one item that took the
// reader away from the one they had just asked to add to. So it mirrors
// startTopPostsInline (top-posts-flow.js): no modal, no navigation, a widget
// turn to pick from, and the pick attaches right here.
//
// ── The mark lands BEFORE the chat opens (the navigating three) ────────────
// Not after, and not on arrival. The reader's last sight of the feed has to be
// the Topic already marked, or the feed they come back to looks like it forgot.
// It is done here rather than in each caller so those three surfaces mean
// exactly the same thing by "Use in chat". The inline path marks at confirm,
// which is the same moment relative to the attach.
//
// ── No echo message, and no question picker (the navigating three) ─────────
// The source-intake card already names the Topic and the composer is right
// there. The inline path DOES follow with a next-steps picker — there the reader
// has not just left a decision behind, they are mid-conversation and the Topic
// has just landed, so "what should I do with it" is the natural next line.
//
// Version pins MUST match screens/session.js's for sources-stream and handoff:
// each keeps per-session state in a module-local Map, and a second copy at a
// different URL would keep its own.
